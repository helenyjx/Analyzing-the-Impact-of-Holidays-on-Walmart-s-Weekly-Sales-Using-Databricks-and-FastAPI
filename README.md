# Project-1-Jiaxin-Ying-
This is a repository about my project 1.
Walmart, one of the leading retail stores in the US, it is also my favorite supermarket since I was a kid. Therefore, For my project 1, I chose a dataset from Kaggle called Walmart, which is about 45 Walmart storesâ€™ historical data that covers sales from 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01.  My project is aimed at searching the main factors which affect its Weekly_Sales from multidimensional views. Specifically, some certain events and holidays will impact sales. Because in my dataset, these special days are Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. In the future, I want to summarize on each special day, the extent to which they affect sales, so that we can intuitively see which day has the largest sales and which day has the weakest impact on sales. Also, several economic factors including Fuel_Price, CPI, and Unemployment rate play important roles in influencing sales. Temperature should be considered as well on daily sales.
